    "brief": "I'm currently an undergraduate studying computer science and economics. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real problems, and I love learning new things that help me approach problems in unique ways. As a result, I always have at least one active side project and am in the process of learning at least one new thing, be it a programming language, framework, or something else entirely! When I'm not building something I can usually be found watching terrible movies or enjoying a cup of tea.",
